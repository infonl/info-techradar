It&#39;s popular for its easy setup and fast, reliable testing capabilities. Cypress can validate various aspects of your application, ranging from the UI functionality to complete workflows.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://infonl.github.io/info-techradar/tools/playwright.html\">Playwright</a> is another powerful tool for end-to-end testing that complements BDD approaches. With support for multiple browsers, headless testing, and API controls, Playwright offers robust testing capabilities for both simple and complex applications.</p>\n<p>Adopting BDD, Gherkin, Cucumber, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://infonl.github.io/info-techradar/tools/cypress.html\">Cypress</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://infonl.github.io/info-techradar/tools/playwright.html\">Playwright</a> in our workflow allows for a clear understanding and discussion of requirements across the team, including non-technical stakeholders. This fosters collaboration and helps prevent miscommunication. Automated testing through Gherkin, Cucumber, Cypress, and Playwright also encourages the development of more robust, bug-free software.</p>\n<p>However, BDD is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It works best when the team is committed to the collaborative approach and when complex business rules need to be understood by all stakeholders.</p>\n","info":"","angleFraction":0.8782118879031613,"radiusFraction":0.534609636655716,"release":"2023-08-01","fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2023-08-01/bdd.md"},{"flag":"default","featured":false,"revisions":[{"name":"bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines","release":"2022-09-22","title":"Bitbucket Cloud & Pipelines","ring":"hold","quadrant":"tools","featured":false,"fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2022-09-22/bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines.md","body":"<p>Having used Bitbucket Cloud &amp; Pipelines for a number of years both for internal and for client\nprojects we have come to the conclusion that it is no longer the best fit for our needs as we feel\n<a href=\"github.html\">GitHub</a> surpasses it in all areas.</p>\n"},{"name":"bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines","release":"2022-05-17","title":"Bitbucket Cloud & Pipelines","ring":"hold","quadrant":"tools","featured":true,"fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2022-05-17/bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines.md","body":"<p>Having used Bitbucket Cloud &amp; Pipelines for a number of years both for internal and for client\nprojects we have come to the conclusion that it is no longer the best fit for our needs as we feel\n<a href=\"github.html\">GitHub</a> surpasses it in all areas.</p>\n"},{"name":"bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines","release":"2021-09-18","title":"Bitbucket Cloud & Pipelines","ring":"assess","quadrant":"tools","featured":true,"fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2021-09-18/bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines.md","body":"<p>The Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud stack is a mature and widely used CI/CD solution offering good integration with various target platforms including AWS and Azure. \nAtlassian at this point does not offer an artifact repository so this solution requires additional tooling: AWS ECR or Azure Artifacts.</p>\n"},{"name":"bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines","release":"2020-09-01","title":"Bitbucket Cloud & Pipelines","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"tools","featured":true,"fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2020-09-01/bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines.md","body":"<p>The Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud stack is a mature and widely used CI/CD solution offering good integration with various target platforms including AWS and Azure. \nAtlassian at this point does not offer an artifact repository so this solution requires additional tooling: AWS ECR or Azure Artifacts.</p>\n"}],"name":"bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines","title":"Bitbucket Cloud & Pipelines","ring":"hold","quadrant":"tools","body":"<p>Having used Bitbucket Cloud &amp; Pipelines for a number of years both for internal and for client\nprojects we have come to the conclusion that it is no longer the best fit for our needs as we feel\n<a href=\"github.html\">GitHub</a> surpasses it in all areas.</p>\n","info":"","angleFraction":0.202887443003952,"radiusFraction":0.9080618405404359,"release":"2022-09-22","fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2022-09-22/bitbucket-cloud-and-pipelines.md"},{"flag":"default","featured":true,"revisions":[{"name":"c4-model","release":"2022-12-05","title":"C4 Model","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"tools","featured":true,"fileName":"/home/runner/work/info-techradar/info-techradar/radar/2022-12-05/c4-model.md","body":"<p>We use the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://c4model.com/\">C4 Model</a> for visualising software architecture.

An event-driven architecture uses events to\ntrigger and communicate between decoupled services and is common in modern applications built with\nmicroservices. An event is a change in state, or an update, like an item being placed in a shopping\ncart on an e-commerce website. Events can either carry the state (the item purchased, its price, and\na delivery address) or events can be identifiers (a notification that an order was shipped).\nEvent-driven architectures have three key components: event producers, event routers, and event\nconsumers. A producer publishes an event to the router, which filters and pushes the events to\nconsumers. Producer services and consumer services are decoupled, which allows them to be scaled,\nupdated, and deployed independently.
