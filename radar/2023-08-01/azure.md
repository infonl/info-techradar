While still generally preferring <a href="aws.html">AWS</a> over Azure as cloud-native platform for our new client solutions we see 
that Azure is gaining traction in our market and that we are getting more requests from our clients to continue to actively support it.

For this reason we have decided to put Azure back to adopt and will continue to support existing and new client solutions running on Azure 
and making sure we maintain our Azure skills in order to do so.
