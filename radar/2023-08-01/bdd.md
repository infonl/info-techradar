Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative approach to software development that bridges the communication gap between business and IT. BDD helps teams focus on delivering features that truly matter by emphasizing the behavior of an application from the end user's perspective.

[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) is Cucumber's language to define test cases. It's designed to be easy to read and lets you write scripts in a natural language style.

[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a tool that supports BDD. It reads Gherkin documents and validates that the code performs as expected.

Adopting BDD, Gherkin, and Cucumber in our workflow allows for a clear understanding and discussion of requirements across the team, including non-technical stakeholders. This fosters collaboration and helps prevent miscommunication. Automated testing through Gherkin and Cucumber also encourages the development of more robust, bug-free software.

However, BDD is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It works best when the team is committed to the collaborative approach and when complex business rules need to be understood by all stakeholders.
