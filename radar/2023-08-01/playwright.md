[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is emerging as a strong competitor in the functional testing landscape. It provides a comprehensive and flexible toolset that extends beyond traditional test automation frameworks. At INFO, we are exploring Playwright for its advanced capabilities in cross-browser automation and rich testing features.



### Why Playwright?

- **Multi-Browser Support:** Unlike many tools, Playwright supports testing on all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with a single API, ensuring consistency across different environments.

- **Complete Isolation:** Each test runs in an isolated browser context, ensuring clean test environments and minimizing flaky tests.

- **Headless and Headful Modes:** Tests can be run in both headless mode for CI environments and headful mode for debugging.

- **Powerful Network Interception:** Playwright provides robust API controls to mock network responses, handle authentication, and manipulate request/response headers for thorough testing.



### Use Cases

- **Web and Mobile Testing:** Effective for desktop and mobile web applications, allowing tests to cover many user scenarios.

- **API Testing:** Playwright enables network interception and API request validation, complementing UI testing.

- **Visual Testing:** Can capture screenshots and compare images, useful for UI regression testing.



### Considerations at INFO

- **Ease of Use:** Playwright's API is powerful but may have a steeper learning curve than Cypress, especially for teams new to end-to-end testing.

- **Integration with CI/CD:** Playwright integrates well with CI/CD pipelines but requires some initial setup compared to the out-of-the-box experience with Cypress.

- **Parallel Testing:** Supports parallel execution to speed up test runs, which is beneficial for large test suites.



As we assess Playwright, we aim to determine how its unique features can complement or enhance our current testing practices.
