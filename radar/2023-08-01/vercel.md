[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a leading Platform as a Service ([PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service)) provider that specializes in frontend deployment and development, providing an efficient and robust infrastructure for modern web applications.

Vercel is the creator of [Next.js](/languages-and-frameworks/nextjs), a popular [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react) framework that is heavily used in our teams. It provides comprehensive support for many frontend technologies, including but not limited to React, Vue, Angular, and Ember.

One of Vercel's significant strengths is its diverse range of services, which significantly streamline and optimize the development process:

- **Infrastructure**: Includes Edge Network for enhanced performance and reliability, Serverless Functions for running server-side code without managing servers, Edge Functions for executing code closer to the user, Edge Middleware for server-side transformations, Image Optimization for automatic compression and resizing of images, Incremental Static Regeneration for rebuilding static pages after they've been deployed, and Edge Cache for high cache hit-rates.

- **Storage**: Vercel provides comprehensive data storage solutions such as Vercel KV for key-value storage, Vercel Postgres for relational data storage, Vercel Blob for storing and retrieving binary data, and Edge Config for storing application configurations at the edge.

Given its extensive capabilities, we recommend adopting Vercel as a PaaS platform in our projects. Its strong alignment with our frontend development needs, seamless GitHub integration, and robust features make it an excellent choice for our teams.

As with any platform, successful adoption will depend on appropriate implementation and the specific needs of each project. Therefore, proper training and preparation should be prioritized to ensure successful adoption.
