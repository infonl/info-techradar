[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is a tool that provides type-safety between your front and back-ends,
hence it makes it really easy to build scalable and robust backends quickly for [Node.js](/languages-and-frameworks/nodejs) based apps.
Currently, the dominant way of making typesafe APIs is using [GraphQL](/languages-and-frameworks/graphql) (it's awesome).
Since GraphQL is a query language for APIs, it doesn't take full advantage of [TypeScript](/languages-and-frameworks/typescript), it comes with excess boilerplate code and requires a lot of initial setup.
If you're already using TypeScript everywhere, you can share types directly between the client and the server without the need of any code generation.
