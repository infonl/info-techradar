[GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages) is a package registry for storing and sharing packages (such as software artifacts) with a team. 

Having used on-premise solutions such as [Nexus Repository](https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository) in the past we want to trial the use of GitHub Packages for our projects that require an artifact repository.
