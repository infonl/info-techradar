[Backstage](https://backstage.io/) is an open platform for building developer portals. Developed by Spotify it provides a centralized place to look up information about the tooling, services, dependencies and architecture of a team's software solution. It can help for example in managing a [Software Bill Of Materials](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/methods-and-patterns/software-bill-of-materials) within a team and even our entire company.

We want to assess the general use case of such platforms in our context and specifically gather experience with Backstage being a market leading solution in this space.
