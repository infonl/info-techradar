We now prefer [Node.js](/languages-and-frameworks/nodejs) as backend technology over [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (and [Java](/languages-and-frameworks/java)).

In the context of choosing the backend technology for new projects, facing challenges in staffing our projects with backend developers and in sharing technical backend skills, we decided to prefer Node.js (and the related [Typescript](/languages-and-frameworks/typescript) stack/ecosystem) over Kotlin (the Kotlin/Java/JVM stack/ecosystem) as our main backend technology, to achieve more consolidation on backend technology within our company, accepting that we will to a large degree stop using the Kotlin (and Java) skills and experiences we have gathered and that we will need to put effort into helping developers switch from Kotlin to Node.js.

We believe that in our current context consolidating on backend technology will make it easier for us to staff and maintain our client projects and we also expect it will make it easier to recruit new developers in future.

We also feel that in the modern, typically distributed, software architectures that we use in our client projects the multi-threading concurrency model of Kotlin/Java/JVM is no longer a decisive benefit over the event loop model of Node.js.
