For internal frontend-backend communication we prefer [tRPC](https://trpc.io) because we think, especially in combination with [Next.js](nextjs.html), it is as a more efficient and more type-safe solution when compared to [GraphQL](graphql.html).

For externally facing ('public') APIs where we are not in control of the clients using our API GraphQL or REST are viable alternatives.
