For internal frontend-backend communication we prefer <a href="https://trpc.io/">tRPC</a> because we think, especially in combination with <a href="Next.js">Next.js</a>, it is as a more efficient and more type-safe solution when compared to <a href="graphql.html">GraphQL</a>.

For externally facing ('public') APIs where we are not in control of the clients using our API GraphQL or REST are viable alternatives.
