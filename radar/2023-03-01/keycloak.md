In the past we have been using Keycloak as our preferred Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. We found this to be a very good fit with our on-premise hosting services. 

But now that we prefer to host our solutions on cloud-native platforms and use (SaaS) cloud services where it makes sense, we find that Keycloak is no longer the best fit for our needs and therefore we now prefer the IAM services that AWS offers (<a href="aws-iam.html">AWS IAM</a> and <a href="amazon-cognito.html">Amazon Cognito</a>) while also trialling the SaaS IAM service <a href="clerk.html">Clerk</a>.
