[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is one of our preferred backend technologies.

When compared to [Kotlin](/languages-and-frameworks/kotlin) we prefer to use Node.js when:

- You want to get started quickly with little overhead. [Kotlin](/languages-and-frameworks/kotlin) projects tend to have somewhat more
  overhead in setting things up, also with regards to the JVM runtime that is used.
- Full-stack development is important. E.g. for smaller projects where developers need to be
  full-stack, Node.js would generally be preferred since Node.js developers can relatively easily do
  frontend development as well, both being [JavaScript](/languages-and-frameworks/javascript) based.
- Doing [serverless](/methods-and-patterns/serverless) development. Node.js is more often used in this area compared to Kotlin and fits
  better with our preferred serverless frameworks
