We prefer to use <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a> for <a href="nodejs.html">Node.js</a> projects when there is a relative high degree of complexity. We feel it is especially well suited for containerised microservices.

NestJS is an opinionated OO-inspired backend MVC framework which allows us build more complex Node.js backends more efficiently. For more simple backends the use of NestJS may be overkill and may add more overhead than is warranted.
