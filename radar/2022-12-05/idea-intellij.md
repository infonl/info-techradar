We now generally prefer [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](/tools/visual-studio-code) as code editor and IDE for developing software in our teams.

However when working on our [Kotlin](/languages-and-frameworks/kotlin) and [Java](/languages-and-frameworks/java) code bases we still prefer to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> as IDE.
