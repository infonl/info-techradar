We now generally prefer <a href="visual-studio-code.html">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> as code editor and IDE for developing software in our teams. 

However when working on our <a href="kotlin.html">Kotlin</a> and <a href="java.html">Java</a> code bases we still prefer to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> as IDE.
