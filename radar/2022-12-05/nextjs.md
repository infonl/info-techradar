<a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is our preferred full-stack web framework for our [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react) and [Node.js](/languages-and-frameworks/nodejs)-based web applications.

Next.js allows us to build React-based web applications efficiently and offers solutions for both server-side rendering as well as statically generated pages.

We also considered <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a> but we believe Next.js is a better match for our needs.
