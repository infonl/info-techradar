Similar to what <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/sentry">ThoughtWorks has said</a> also in our case <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> has become our tool os choice for front-end error reporting in our teams.

It is very easy to use and helps our teams a lot in error monitoring, reporting and debugging.
