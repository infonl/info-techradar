In the space of software quality assurance and software security tooling we are assessing using <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> in our teams.

Having used other similar tooling in the past (mostly SonarQube) we feel that Snyk is delivering the most extensive featureset which fits with our needs. At the same time we are also keeping an eye on the (upcoming) offerings by <a href="github.html">GitHub</a> in this space and we will continue to use GitHub's Dependabot automated dependency update tool.
