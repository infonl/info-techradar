In the space of Identity and Access Management we prefer to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS IAM</a> and/or [Amazon Cognito](/platforms-and-operations/amazon-cognito) depending on the specific needs of a project.

We are also trialling the SaaS IAM service [Clerk](/platforms-and-operations/clerk) as an alternative solution for projects which are not using AWS as the main platform (but typically use a [PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service) provider instead).
