In the space of Identity and Access Management we prefer to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS IAM</a> and/or <a href="amazon-cognito.html">Amazon Cognito</a> depending on the specific needs of a project.

We are also trialling the SaaS IAM service <a href="clerk.html">Clerk</a> as an alternative solution for projects which are not using AWS as the main platform (but typically use a PaaS provider instead).
