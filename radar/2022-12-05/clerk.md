In the space of Identity and Access Management (IAM) we are trialling <a href="https://clerk.dev/">Clerk</a> as a potential IAM solution for projects which are not using AWS as the main platform (but typically use PaaS provider instead).

For AWS-based solutions we generally prefer to use <a href="aws-iam.html">AWS IAM</a> and/or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>.

We have also considered alternatives such as <a href="https://www.ory.sh/">Ory</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> but, while very similar, we believe Clerk will be the best fit for our needs.
