We are assessing <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> as general PaaS provider.

We believe for solutions where the complexity of <a href="aws.html">AWS</a> is not warranted a PaaS provider can offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative over a traditional cloud provider such as AWS.

In the same space we are also trialing <a href="vercel.html">Vercel</a> and assessing <a href="digitalocean.html">DigitalOcean</a>.
