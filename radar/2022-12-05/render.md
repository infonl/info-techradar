We are assessing [Render](https://render.com/) as general [PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service) provider.

We believe for solutions where the complexity of [AWS](/platforms-and-operations/aws) is not warranted a PaaS provider can offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative over a traditional cloud provider such as AWS.

In the same space we are also trialing [Vercel](/platforms-and-operations/vercel) and assessing [DigitalOcean](/platforms-and-operations/digitalocean).
