Our preferred relational database is (and has been for many years) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. We prefer it over cloud-vendor specific relational databases. In our projects we experienced several shortcomings in such cloud-vendor specific relational databases and we see no advantages in using them over PostgreSQL. 

<a href="aws.html">AWS</a> as well as <a href="dbaas.html">DBaaS</a> providers support PostgreSQL (or are compatible with it). When on AWS it may be that Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL may be a preferred choice over Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL depending on your (business) requirements. Please see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/is-amazon-rds-for-postgresql-or-amazon-aurora-postgresql-a-better-choice-for-me/">Is Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL a better choice for me?</a> for more details.
