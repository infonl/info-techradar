We prefer AWS as our general all purpose cloud-native platform because AWS is the (local as well as global) market leader in the space of cloud-native computing, and we think it offers the best set of services for our needs when compared to other cloud providers.

However we are also trialling and assessing various PaaS providers such as <a href="vercel.html">Vercel</a> to see if these providers can become our preferred hosting platform(s) for solutions where the functionality and related complexity that AWS offers is not required. We believe in such cases a PaaS provider offers a cheaper and more flexible alternative over a traditional cloud provider such as AWS.
