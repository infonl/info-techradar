We prefer [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) as our general all purpose cloud-native platform because AWS is the (local as well as global) market leader in the space of cloud-native computing, and we think it offers the best set of services for our needs when compared to other cloud providers.

However we are also trialling and assessing various [PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service) providers such as [Vercel](/platforms-and-operations/vercel) to see if these providers can become our preferred hosting platform(s) for solutions where the functionality and related complexity that AWS offers is not required. We believe in such cases a PaaS provider offers a cheaper and more flexible alternative over a traditional cloud provider such as AWS.
