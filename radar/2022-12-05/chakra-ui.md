We prefer to use <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra UI</a> to build [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react)-based component libraries in our projects, depening on the requirements of the project. For most project we do prefer [Tailwind CSS](/languages-and-frameworks/tailwind-css) in this space.

We strongly believe in using [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) as a design methodology in our projects and we believe Chakra UI is an excellent fit for this.

We considered the <a href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled Components</a> framework but we believe Chakra UI to be a better fit.
