We prefer to use <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra UI</a> to build <a href="react.html">React</a>-based component libraries in our projects. 

We strongly believe in using Atomic Design as a design methodology in our projects and we believe Chakra UI is an excellent fit for this. 

We considered the <a href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled Components</a> framework but we believe Chakra UI to be a better fit.
