In the space of Content Management Systems or content platforms we are trialling the SaaS headless content platform [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io).

While [Strapi](/tools/strapi) is our preferred CMS, it is not a SaaS service. The new upcoming Strapi Cloud offering will also not but a full SaaS content platform but rather a [PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service) CMS solution. Depending on the needs of a project a SaaS content platform may be required or a better fit over a PaaS CMS solution. In such cases we think that a service such as Sanity can be good match.

While there are many alternative SaaS content platforms on the market, some of which we have also considered including [Contentful](/platforms-and-operations/contentful), we believe Sanity holds the best cards for our needs mainly because of it's ease of use, it's strong focus on a good developer experience and because it allows for a great deal of flexibility.
