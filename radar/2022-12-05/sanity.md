In the space of Content Management Systems or content platforms we are trialling the SaaS headless content platform <a href="https://www.sanity.io//">Sanity</a>. 

While <a href="strapi.html">Strapi</a> is our preferred CMS, it is not a SaaS service. The new upcoming Strapi Cloud offering will also not but a full SaaS content platform but rather a PaaS CMS solution. Depending on the needs of a project a SaaS content platform may be required or a better fit over a PaaS CMS solution. In such cases we think that a service such as Sanity can be good match.

While there are many alternative SaaS content platforms on the market, we believe Sanity holds the best cards for our needs mainly because of it's ease of use, it's strong focus on a good developer experience and because it allows for a great deal of flexibility.
