We prefer to use <a href="https://vitest.dev/">Vitest</a> as [Typescript](/languages-and-frameworks/typeScript) unit test framework.

We have have been using other unit test frameworks like [Jest](/languages-and-frameworks/jest) and [Mocha](/languages-and-frameworks/mocha) in our projects as well but mainly due to the better performance we now prefer Vitest. Vitest is compatible with Jest and therefore this is not a huge change when switching from Jest.
