In the space of search platforms we are trialling <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>. Algolia is an API-based SaaS search service which we think is very easy to implement in our projects. It also integrates nicely with <a href="strapi.html">Strapi</a>.

For our AWS-based projects you may consider using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/">Amazon CloudSearch</a> instead, depending on your specific needs.
