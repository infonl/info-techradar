In the space of search platforms we are trialling [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com). Algolia is an API-based SaaS search service which we think is very easy to implement in our projects. It also integrates nicely with [Strapi](/tools/strapi).

For our AWS-based projects you may consider using [Amazon CloudSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch) instead, depending on your specific needs.
