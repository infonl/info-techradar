We prefer to use the free open-source source code editor <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> for developing software in our teams.

It is the most widely used code editor (and IDE with the right extensions) for working with <a href="typescript.html">TypeScript</a> code bases and it serves all our needs.

However when working on our <a href="kotlin.html">Kotlin</a> and <a href="java.html">Java</a> code bases we generally still prefer to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> as IDE.
