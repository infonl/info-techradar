We are trialling <a href="https://turbo.build/repo">Turborepo</a> to see if it can become our preferred <a href="monorepo.html">monorepo</a> solution. 

Turborepo is made by <a href="vercel.html">Vercel</a>, who are also the creators of <a href="nextjs.html">Next.js</a>, and the out-of-the-box integration provided between these frameworks and services can be decisive factor, while still taking into account other considerations such as a strong dependency on Vercel.
