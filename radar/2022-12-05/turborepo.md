We are trialling <a href="https://turbo.build/repo">Turborepo</a> to see if it can become our preferred [monorepo](/methods-and-patterns/monorepo) solution.

Turborepo is made by [Vercel](/platforms-and-operations/vercel), who are also the creators of [Next.js](/languages-and-frameworks/nextjs), and the out-of-the-box integration provided between these frameworks and services can be decisive factor, while still taking into account other considerations such as a strong dependency on Vercel.

We also considered the <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx</a> monorepo framework but after having trialed it we feel that Turborepo is a better fit for our needs.
