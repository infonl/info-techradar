We prefer to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> as cloud object storage solution.
S3 is de de-facto industry standard in this space and is used as object store not just for solutions that are fully hosted on <a href="aws.html">AWS</a> but also for other, for example [PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service), solutions.
