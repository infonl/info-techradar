We use the <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 Model</a> for visualising software architecture. By doing so we also use the C4 vocabulary when describing software architectures. We focus on System Context and Container diagrams and not so much on the low-level Component and Code diagrams.

Having used UML in the (distant) past and free-format diagramming since then we feel that we miss a level of consistency in both visualising as well as describing our software architectures. We think that C4 brings us just enough consolidation but still leaves for enough flexibility on how to use it.
