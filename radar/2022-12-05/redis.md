We prefer to use <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> as in-memory key-value data store for specific cases such as a custom cache or queue management solution. In such relatively simple cases a relational database would be overkill and not a good fit. 

Redis is market leader in this area and fulfils all our needs.
