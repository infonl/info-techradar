We are assessing <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> as general PaaS provider. It is the PaaS market leader and provides a wide range of generic PaaS functionalities.

We believe for solutions where the complexity of <a href="aws.html">AWS</a> is not warranted a PaaS provider can offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative over a traditional cloud provider such as AWS.

In the same space we are also trialing <a href="vercel.html">Vercel</a> and assessing <a href="render.html">Render</a>.
