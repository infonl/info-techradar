We prefer TypeScript to [JavaScript](/languages-and-frameworks/typescript). Our decision in more detail:

In the context of creating user-interfaces with [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react) and back-end applications
using [Node.js](/languages-and-frameworks/nodejs), facing the proliferation of different languages used within INFO and the engineering
communities at large we decided for TypeScript as the preferred language in favor of [JavaScript](/languages-and-frameworks/javascript) and
neglected Flow and others languages, to achieve a common way of working that will allow software
engineers to work on or maintain multiple code bases over multiple projects, accepting limiting the
options for teams and individual engineers to select their tools.
