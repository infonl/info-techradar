[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) has emerged as our preferred tool in the functional testing landscape, offering a comprehensive and flexible toolset that extends beyond traditional test automation frameworks. At INFO, we have adopted Playwright for its advanced capabilities in cross-browser automation and rich testing features.

### Why Playwright?

- **Multi-Browser Support:** Supports testing on all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with a single API, ensuring consistency across different environments.

- **Complete Isolation:** Each test runs in an isolated browser context, ensuring clean test environments and minimizing flaky tests.

- **Headless and Headful Modes:** Tests can be run in both headless mode for CI environments and headful mode for debugging.

- **Powerful Network Interception:** Provides robust API controls to mock network responses, handle authentication, and manipulate request/response headers for thorough testing.



### Use Cases

- **Web and Mobile Testing:** Effective for desktop and mobile web applications, allowing tests to cover a wide range of user scenarios.

- **API Testing:** Enables network interception and API request validation, complementing UI testing.

- **Visual Testing:** Can capture screenshots and compare images, useful for UI regression testing.



### Adoption at INFO

- **Preferred Testing Tool:** Playwright is now the preferred tool for functional testing due to its advanced features and flexibility.

- **Integration with Workflows:** Seamlessly integrates with our CI/CD pipelines and development workflows.

- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Facilitates better collaboration between developers and QA engineers through its robust and versatile API.



Playwright's unique features have complemented and enhanced our testing practices, leading to its adoption as the primary tool for functional testing at INFO.
