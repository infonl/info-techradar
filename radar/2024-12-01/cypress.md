[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has been a valuable tool for functional testing at INFO, known for its robustness and developer-friendly environment. However, as we prioritize advanced testing capabilities and cross-browser support, Cypress is now on hold while we focus on [Playwright](/tools/playwright) as our preferred solution.



### Previous Benefits of Cypress

- **Developer Experience:** Provided a smooth setup process, real-time reloading, and direct debugging in the browser, enhancing productivity.

- **End-to-end Testing:** Offered support for end-to-end, integration, and unit testing within a single framework.

- **Automatic Waiting:** Automatically waited for elements to be ready, reducing the need for manual wait commands.

- **Robust Ecosystem:** Had a rich plugin ecosystem for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and reporting tools.



### Reasons for Holding

- **Limited Cross-Browser Support:** Cypress has limitations in supporting multiple browsers compared to Playwright's comprehensive coverage.

- **Scaling Challenges:** As testing needs grow, Playwright offers better scalability and performance for large test suites.

- **Advanced Features:** Playwright's advanced capabilities in network interception and browser context isolation provide more robust testing options.



### Considerations at INFO

- **Transition to Playwright:** Teams are transitioning to Playwright to take advantage of its enhanced features and flexibility.

- **Support and Maintenance:** While on hold, existing Cypress tests will be maintained, but no new tests will be developed using Cypress.

- **Training and Resources:** Resources are being allocated to train teams on Playwright to ensure a smooth transition.



Cypress played a significant role in our testing strategy, but with Playwright's adoption, we are focusing on tools that better meet our evolving testing requirements.
