[Render](https://render.com/) is a general-purpose Platform as a Service ([PaaS](/platforms-and-operations/platform-as-a-service)) provider that simplifies cloud deployment by offering an intuitive interface for hosting web applications, databases, and microservices. Initially assessed as a potential alternative for projects where the complexity of AWS is not warranted, Render aimed to provide a cheaper and more flexible solution compared to traditional cloud providers.

### Previous Benefits of Render

- **Ease of Deployment:** Simplified the process of deploying applications with minimal configuration, allowing developers to focus more on code and less on infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective Solutions:** Offered competitive pricing models suitable for startups and small to medium-sized projects.
- **Integrated Features:** Included built-in services like automatic SSL certificates, custom domains, and DDoS protection without additional configuration.

### Reasons for Holding

- **Standardizing Cloud Offerings:** To streamline our cloud infrastructure, we are focusing on mainstream providers like [AWS](/platforms-and-operations/aws), [Azure](/platforms-and-operations/azure), and Google Cloud that offer more comprehensive services and better integration capabilities.
- **Competitive Alternatives:** Platforms like [Vercel](/platforms-and-operations/vercel) and [DigitalOcean](/platforms-and-operations/digitalocean) provide similar or enhanced features with greater scalability and community support.
- **Lack of Distinct Advantages:** Render does not offer significant benefits over competitors that would justify its continued adoption within our technology stack.

### Current Stance at INFO

While Render has been valuable for simplifying deployments, we are placing it on hold to concentrate on standardizing our cloud offerings with providers that align better with our long-term strategic goals. We believe this focus will help us maintain consistency, improve scalability, and leverage the extensive feature sets of major cloud platforms. Existing projects on Render will be maintained, but future deployments will prioritize platforms that offer more concrete benefits compared to competitors.
