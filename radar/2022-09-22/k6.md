[k6](https://k6.io/) is a modern and strong load & performance (and stress) test tool.
Being [JavaScript](/languages-and-frameworks/javascript)-based it is typically easier to use in our teams compared to other
load & performance test tooling.

We have been using it for some time in our client teams with good results.
