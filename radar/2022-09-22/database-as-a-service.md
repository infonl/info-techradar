Database as a Service (or Serverless Database) is a modern cloud-based database solution where you no longer need to 
manage and maintain the underlying database technologies. 
Many cloud vendors are starting to offer solutions in this space.

We want to assess if DBaaS solutions can help our client teams and what impact it would have when 
we start using them.
