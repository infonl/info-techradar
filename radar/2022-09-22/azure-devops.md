Having used Azure DevOps for some client projects we have come to the conclusion that it is not the
best fit for our needs as we feel <a href="github.html">GitHub</a> surpasses it in all areas. Both are owned by Microsoft but
Microsoft seems to put all their cards on GitHub. We see no reason to choose Azure DevOps over
GitHub even for cloud-native Azure projects.
