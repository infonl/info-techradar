It provides a comprehensive and flexible toolset that extends beyond traditional test automation frameworks. At INFO, we are exploring Playwright for its advanced capabilities in cross-browser automation and rich testing features.</p>
<h3 id="why-playwright">Why Playwright?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Browser Support:</strong> Unlike many tools, Playwright supports testing on all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with a single API, ensuring consistency across different environments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Complete Isolation:** Each test runs in an isolated browser context, ensuring clean test environments and minimizing flaky tests.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Headless and Headful Modes:</strong> Tests can be run in both headless mode for CI environments and headful mode for debugging.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Powerful Network Interception:</strong> Playwright provides robust API controls to mock network responses, handle authentication, and manipulate request/response headers for thorough testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Web and Mobile Testing:</strong> Effective for desktop and mobile web applications, allowing tests to cover many user scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>API Testing:</strong> Playwright enables network interception and API request validation, complementing UI testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Testing:</strong> Can capture screenshots and compare images, useful for UI regression testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="considerations-at-info">Considerations at INFO</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Playwright's API is powerful but may have a steeper learning curve than Cypress, especially for teams new to end-to-end testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Integration with CI/CD:</strong> Playwright integrates well with CI/CD pipelines but requires some initial setup compared to the out-of-the-box experience with Cypress.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Parallel Testing:</strong> Supports parallel execution to speed up test runs, which is beneficial for large test suites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we assess Playwright, we aim to determine how its unique features can complement or enhance our current testing practices.</p>
