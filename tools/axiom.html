<p>In this same space we do also use <a href="sentry.html">Sentry</a>. However Sentry is focused on frontend error logging, while tools such as Axiom fit the need for all-purpose (application and system) logging.</p>
<p>There are many other players in this field, some of which we have used or trialled inclusing Logtail and Datadog but for us Axiom holds the best cards for our needs. We have also found that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/centralized-logging/">centralized logging solution offered by AWS</a> is too cumbersome to use and does not offer the same range of features that tools like Axiom do.</p>
