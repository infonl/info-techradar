<p>While <a href="strapi.html">Strapi</a> is our preferred CMS, it is not a SaaS service. The new upcoming Strapi Cloud offering will also not but a full SaaS content platform but rather a PaaS CMS solution. Depending on the needs of a project a SaaS content platform may be required or a better fit over a PaaS CMS solution. In such cases we think that a service such as Sanity can be good match.</p>
<p>While there are many alternative SaaS content platforms on the market, some of which we have also considered including <a href="contentful.html">Contentful</a>, we believe Sanity holds the best cards for our needs mainly because of it's ease of use, it's strong focus on a good developer experience and because it allows for a great deal of flexibility.</p>
