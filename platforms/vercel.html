<p>Vercel is the creator of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next. js</a>, a popular React framework that is heavily used in our teams. It provides comprehensive support for many frontend technologies, including but not limited to React, Vue, Angular, and Ember.</p>
<p>One of Vercel's significant strengths is its diverse range of services, which significantly streamline and optimize the development process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Includes Edge Network for enhanced performance and reliability, Serverless Functions for running server-side code without managing servers, Edge Functions for executing code closer to the user, Edge Middleware for server-side transformations, Image Optimization for automatic compression and resizing of images, Incremental Static Regeneration for rebuilding static pages after they've been deployed, and Edge Cache for high cache hit-rates.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Storage</strong>: Vercel provides comprehensive data storage solutions such as Vercel KV for key-value storage, Vercel Postgres for relational data storage, Vercel Blob for storing and retrieving binary data, and Edge Config for storing application configurations at the edge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given its extensive capabilities, we recommend adopting Vercel as a PaaS platform in our projects. Its strong alignment with our frontend development needs, seamless GitHub integration, and robust features make it an excellent choice for our teams.</p>
<p>As with any platform, successful adoption will depend on appropriate implementation and the specific needs of each project. Therefore, proper training and preparation should be prioritized to ensure successful adoption.</p>
