The main reason for this decision is that at this moment in time we wish to consolidate more on our preferred technology stack to make it easier for us to staff our projects and maintain our client solutions.</p>
<p>We prefer AWS over Azure since AWS is the (local as well as global) market leader in the space of cloud-native computing, and we think offers the best set of services for our needs. Next to AWS we are trialing and assessing PaaS solutions as well.</p>
<p>Eventhough we now favour AWS we will continue to support our existing client solutions running on Azure and we will make sure we maintain our Azure skills in order to do so.</p>
