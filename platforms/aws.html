<p>However we are also trialling and assessing various PaaS providers such as <a href="vercel.html">Vercel</a> to see if these providers can become our preferred hosting platform(s) for solutions where the functionality and related complexity that AWS offers is not required. We believe in such cases a PaaS provider offers a cheaper and more flexible alternative over a traditional cloud provider such as AWS.</p>
